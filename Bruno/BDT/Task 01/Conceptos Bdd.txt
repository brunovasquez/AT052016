Research :
1.-When and why BDD was defined

R.-In the years 2099 Dan North presented as a response to the problems that arose as:
Where to start in the process.
To try and do not try.
How much testing in a single opportunity.
How to call evidence.
Understanding why a test fails.

2.-The most important aspects of BDD

R.-In BDD not only tested units or classes, test scenarios and behavior of the classes in meeting these scenarios, which can be composed of various kinds.
It helps us focus on what is truly important to the 'business'
If we generate tests with a particular language, we can serve in making the acceptance test.

3.-Why is useful and when could be applied.
Collaboration 
Simple Specification  -> Ubiquitous language
Easy Feedback 
Avoid rework in requirements definition
Self documentation 
Focus on Behavior
